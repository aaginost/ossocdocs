### Policy Statement

The SOC must make every effort to minimize business impact or interruption by thoroughly evaluating the validity of use or communication with any resource prior to blocking that resource. While it is crucial to block malicious domains, email senders, processes, etc., every effort should be made to ensure that such containment activities do not negatively impact legitimate business processes or cause unnecessary disruption.

## Policy Elements

    1. SOC personnel must assess whether there is valid use or communication with any resource before taking action to block or delete it.
- **Impact Assessment**
    1. SOC personnel must scope the potential impact of any block or deletion to ensure there is no negative outcome for the organization
- **Proportional Response**
    1. Actions taken must be proportionate to the threat level. SOC personnel must conduct sufficient research to justify any block, deletion, or process interruption.
- **Consultation and Communication**
    1. In cases of potential business impact, the appropriate business owner or representative must be consulted and informed.
- **Escalation**
    1. If there is any ambiguity or uncertainty, cases should be escalated to the SOC Director
