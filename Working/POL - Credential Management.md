## Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to establish strict guidelines for managing credentials within the Security Operations Center (SOC). Given the SOCâ€™s access to sensitive systems and critical data, it is essential to maintain strong authentication and credential management practices to mitigate security risks.
## Scope
This policy applies to all SOC personnel, including SOC Analysts, Shift Leads, SOC Leadership, and any individual granted access to sensitive security systems. It governs the handling, storage, and use of credentials for all SOC-related accounts.

## Policy Statement
SOC personnel must adhere to strict credential management protocols to protect systems and sensitive data. Credentials must be uniquely assigned, strictly confidential, and used exclusively by the designated individual. Proper authentication measures, including strong passwords, hardware tokens, passkeys, and MFA, must be employed to maintain security.
### Policy Elements
####  1. Prohibition of Credential Sharing

- Credentials must be assigned to a single individual and **must never be shared**.
- Shared or group accounts are prohibited unless explicitly approved by SOC leadership and configured with appropriate auditing controls.

### 2. Strong Password and Authentication Requirements

- SOC analysts must choose strong, unique passwords for all company systems.
- Passwords must comply with company policies and should exceed minimum security standards.
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) must be enabled wherever possible.
- Passkeys, hardware tokens, or smart cards must be utilized where possible.

### 3. Secure Credential Storage

- Credential data must not be stored externally, including third-party systems or personal devices.
- Password managers, if approved by SOC leadership, must be company-sanctioned and secured.
- Writing down passwords in physical or digital notes is strictly prohibited.

### 4. Credential Expiry and Account Revocation

- SOC analysts who depart the organization must notify the company to ensure credentials are expired and accounts revoked.
- All access rights must be immediately terminated upon departure to prevent unauthorized access.

### 5. Compliance and Reporting

- SOC analysts must complete all mandatory security training related to credential management.
- Any suspected or actual credential compromise must be reported immediately to SOC leadership.
- Regular audits must be conducted to ensure compliance with credential security policies.

### 6. Additional Best Practices

- SOC analysts must change passwords periodically in accordance with company policy.
- Avoid using the same password across multiple systems.
- Enable alerts for unauthorized access attempts where applicable.
- Review and update access permissions regularly to ensure least privilege access is enforced.

## Enforcement and Compliance
By following this policy, SOC personnel will ensure the highest standards of security and access control, protecting the company from credential-based threats and unauthorized access. Failure to comply with this policy may lead to disciplinary action up to, and including, account termination.

## Policy Review
This policy will be reviewed at least annually by SOC leadership.
