## Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to prevent the unintentional exposure of sensitive company data to unlicensed third-party tools or the public. This includes, but is not limited to, situations where the Security Operations Center (SOC), during the course of an investigation, submits evidence to external tools or websites (e.g., cyberchef, urlscan.io , VirusTotal) that may result in a data privacy breach. The policy ensures the SOC adheres to strict guidelines for using only approved, licensed tools and protects the company from unauthorized data disclosure.

## Scope
This policy applies to all Security Operations Center (SOC) personnel, contractors, and any individuals performing investigative or analytical tasks on behalf of the SOC. It covers all tools, platforms, and services used for investigation, analysis, or evidence submission and pertains to any data generated, handled, or submitted during SOC operations.

## Policy Statement
SOC personnel are strictly prohibited from submitting any company data, including investigative evidence, to unlicensed or unapproved third-party tools or websites.

The following rules apply:

- **Licensed Tools Only**: Only use tools that are expressly approved and licensed by the company.
- **Documentation and Approval**: Any use of unlicensed or unapproved tools must be documented, and prior approval must be obtained from the SOC Manager.
- **Sensitive Data Handling**: All sensitive company data must be anonymized or redacted before submission, even when using licensed tools, unless submission of unaltered data is explicitly required and approved.

SOC personnel must ensure due diligence to evaluate the data handling and privacy policies of third-party tools before use.
