## Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to establish a fair and equitable approach for managing holiday scheduling within the Security Operations Center (SOC). Given the 24x7 operational requirement of the SOC, traditional organizational holidays cannot be fully observed. This policy outlines a framework that allows SOC Analysts to select personal holiday days in alignment with the total number of company-recognized holidays, ensuring both operational continuity and individual flexibility.
## Scope
This policy applies to all SOC personnel, including full-time and part-time SOC Analysts, scheduling personnel, and new hires joining the SOC after the start of the calendar year. It governs the process by which SOC Analysts select their holiday days, how these selections are scheduled, and the procedures for compensation when an analyst is required to work on a selected holiday.

## Policy Statement
The SOC will operate continuously, and as such, traditional company holidays cannot be fully observed by all SOC staff. To promote fairness and personal recognition of significant days, each SOC Analyst is allocated a number of holiday days equivalent to the company-recognized holidays. Analysts are responsible for selecting their holiday days at the start of the year. Scheduling will prioritize early submissions, but flexibility is required as not all requests may be accommodated due to operational demands. New hires will receive prorated holiday selections, and if an Analyst is required to work on a selected holiday, they will receive compensation as per established guidelines.
### Policy Elements

### 1. **Holiday Allocation:**

- The total number of company-recognized holidays will be tallied annually and allocated equally to each SOC Analyst.
- At the beginning of the year, each Analyst must submit their preferred holiday dates equivalent to this number.

### 2. **Selection Process:**

- Holiday selections will be submitted through the designated scheduling system.
- Requests will be processed on a first-come, first-served basis.
- In cases where a selected holiday cannot be scheduled due to operational requirements, the Analyst must choose an alternate day.

### 3. **New Hire Adjustments:**

- SOC Analysts joining after the start of the year will receive a prorated number of holiday selections based on the remaining calendar period.
- New hires must complete their holiday selection within the first month of employment.

### 4. **Compensation for Working on Holidays:**

- If an Analyst is required to work on a day that was selected as a holiday, standard holiday compensation policies will apply.
- This includes a day-in-lieu and applicable holiday bonus pay, as per the organization's compensation policy.
## Enforcement and Compliance
The SOC Manager and Scheduling team will monitor adherence to this policy. Regular audits will be conducted to ensure that holiday selections and compensations are processed in accordance with the policy. Any deviations or non-compliance with this policy will be reviewed and may result in corrective actions.  Repeated or intentional non-compliance may lead to further disciplinary measures as outlined in the organization's broader HR policies.

## Policy Review
This policy will be reviewed annually by all employees to ensure its continued relevance and effectiveness. Feedback and suggestions for improvement are welcome and should be directed to the SOC Leadership.
