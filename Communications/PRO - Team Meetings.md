## Purpose
The purpose of this process is to establish a structured and efficient approach for conducting Security Operations Center (SOC) team meetings. These meetings provide a forum for discussing operational updates, recognizing achievements, sharing knowledge, and maintaining alignment within the team. Ensuring effective communication across shifts is critical to maintaining SOC readiness and collaboration.

## Scope
his process applies to all SOC personnel, including analysts, engineers, and leadership. It governs the scheduling, organization, and execution of SOC team meetings and ensures that:

- Meetings are accessible to all SOC team members, regardless of shift schedule.
- Key operational and organizational updates are consistently shared.
- Meeting content is documented and stored for future reference.

## **Prerequisites**

Before conducting a SOC team meeting, the following must be in place:

1. **Scheduling Considerations** – A time slot must be selected to maximize attendance, with rotating schedules if necessary.
2. **Meeting Invitations** – Invitations must be sent to all SOC personnel, including those not on shift, with a clear agenda.
3. **Presentation Materials** – Meeting slides, notes, and other resources should be prepared and stored in a shared repository for pre- and post-meeting review.
4. **Video Conferencing Setup** – A virtual meeting link must be provided to enable remote attendance and recording.
5. **Agenda Development** – A structured agenda must be prepared, including recurring topics and discussion points.

## Process Steps
### **Step 1: Scheduling the Meeting**

- Determine the most suitable time for maximum attendance, considering shift schedules.
- If a single time slot does not work for all, rotate meeting times for inclusivity.
- Schedule the meeting at least one week in advance and send calendar invites to all SOC personnel.
- Invite new SOC personnel to the meeting series.

### **Step 2: Preparing the Meeting Agenda**

- Develop a structured agenda that includes recurring themes such as:
    - Operational Changes: Updates on security tools, policies, or response strategies.
    - Company Announcements: Relevant updates impacting the SOC team.
    - Recognition & Achievements: Acknowledging team contributions, milestones, and awards.
    - Project Status Updates: Progress reports on ongoing security initiatives.
    - Threat Intelligence Briefings: Insights from Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) and Threat Hunting teams.
- Share the agenda in advance to allow attendees to prepare discussion points or contributions.

### **Step 3: Preparing and Storing Meeting Materials**

- Prepare presentation slides or supporting documents covering the agenda topics.
- Upload materials to a shared repository (e.g., SharePoint, Confluence) before the meeting.
- Ensure all attendees have access to review materials ahead of time.

### **Step 4: Conducting the Meeting**

- Start the meeting on time, following the predefined agenda.
- Allow space for discussions, Q&A, and analyst presentations.
- Recognize team achievements and foster a positive, collaborative environment.
- Record the meeting for those unable to attend in real time.

### **Step 5: Storing and Sharing Meeting Content**

- Summarize key takeaways and action items in a follow-up email or chat message.

### **Step 6: Tracking Action Items and Continuous Improvement**

- Document any follow-up actions or assigned tasks during the meeting.
- Assign responsible team members and deadlines for action items.
