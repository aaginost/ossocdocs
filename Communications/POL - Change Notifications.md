## Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to establish guidelines for timely and effective communication of changes within the Security Operations Center (SOC). Given the dynamic nature of cybersecurity operations, change notifications are critical to ensuring smooth SOC operations, timely cybersecurity response, and reducing the risk of errors or oversights. This policy enforces structured change communication and ensures all SOC analysts receive and acknowledge important updates.

## Scope

This policy applies to all changes impacting SOC operations, including but not limited to:

- Updates to security tools, platforms, and technologies
- Modifications in incident response protocols
- Changes in monitoring and alerting configurations
- Adjustments to shift schedules and team structures
- Implementation of new policies and compliance directives

All SOC personnel, including analysts, engineers, and leadership, must comply with this policy to ensure effective change communication and implementation.

## Policy Statement

Timely communication of operational changes is critical to SOC efficiency and security response effectiveness. All changes affecting SOC operations must be documented, reviewed, and communicated in a structured manner. To ensure comprehensive awareness, all change notifications must be communicated at least **three times in three different formats**, such as:

- **Verbal Announcement** during shift handoff or team meetings.
- **Chat Notification** in a designated SOC change communication channel.
- **Email Notification** using standardized subject lines for easy filtering.

Additionally, all change notifications must include an impact assessment, a rollback plan, an acknowledgment process, and an implementation timeline.

### Policy Elements

#### **1. Change Documentation**

- Every change must be clearly documented, including:
    - Description of the change
    - Justification and expected impact
    - Effective date and implementation plan
    - Rollback plan in case of unintended impacts
    - Test plan to ensure effectiveness of the change.
    - Required actions for SOC analysts
    - Links to supporting documentation and training materials

#### **2. Communication Methods**

- Every change must be communicated using the "three times, three formats" approach:
    
    1. **Verbal Announcement:**
        - Discuss during SOC shift handoff meetings.
        - Announce at team meetings or daily stand-ups.
    2. **Chat Notification:**
        - Post details in a designated chat channel (e.g., "#SOC-Change-Alerts").
        - Tag relevant team members to ensure visibility.
    3. **Email Notification:**
        - Send an email to the SOC distribution list with the subject formatted as:
            - **[SOC CHANGE NOTICE] [Brief Change Summary] [Effective Date]**
        - Email must include summary, links to documentation, and required actions.

#### **3. Acknowledgment Process**

- SOC analysts must confirm receipt of change notifications through one of the following methods:
    - Replying to the email with "Acknowledged."
    - Updating a shared tracking document (e.g., SharePoint, Confluence, or ticketing system).
    - Confirming receipt in the designated chat channel.
- SOC leadership is responsible for tracking acknowledgments and following up with non-responders.

#### **4. Training and Documentation**

- Training sessions, documentation, and videos must be created and updated for all significant changes.
- Training should be accessible to all SOC personnel and linked in change notifications.

#### **5. Implementation Plan and Rollback Strategy**

- Each change must have a defined implementation timeline and, where applicable, a rollback strategy.
- SOC leadership ensures continuous monitoring of change effectiveness and quickly addresses any issues.

 ## Enforcement and Compliance
Failure to adhere to this policy may result in operational inefficiencies, security vulnerabilities, or non-compliance risks. SOC leadership is responsible for enforcing compliance, monitoring adherence, and taking corrective actions when necessary.
