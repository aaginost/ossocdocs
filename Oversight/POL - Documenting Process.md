## Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to establish clear guidelines for documenting processes, procedures, and investigative activities within the Security Operations Center (SOC). By systematically documenting SOC processes and workflows, the organization ensures reliable, repeatable, and measurable results from investigative efforts. While the nature of cybersecurity is dynamic and constantly evolving, maintaining well-documented processes helps create a baseline of performance, supports continuous improvement, and fosters transparency. The goal is to have consistent documentation covering repeatable components such as ticket creation, user and asset enumeration, investigative techniques, and alert handling. This policy ensures that any gaps in documentation are identified, tracked, and addressed to maintain a living repository that adapts to new challenges and opportunities.

## Scope
This policy applies to all personnel within the Security Operations Center (SOC). The policy covers all documented processes, investigative techniques, and procedures used within the SOC, including alert handling, ticket creation, asset tracking, and user enumeration. It applies to any situation where SOC processes or techniques are utilized, and documentation is required or should be improved.

## Policy Statement
The SOC is committed to ensuring reliable, repeatable results from investigative activities by maintaining thorough documentation of processes and procedures. SOC analysts must document and follow established workflows, ensuring consistency and transparency in operations. When analysts encounter any process, technique, or alert handling procedure that is not documented, they are required to raise it with SOC leadership. The leadership team will maintain a backlog of missing or incomplete documentation, prioritize it, and schedule development timelines and projects. This policy encourages continuous improvement, transparency, and accountability by ensuring all processes are documented, reviewed regularly, and kept up to date to reflect changes in the threat landscape.

### Policy Elements
#### 1. Documentation of Process and Procedures

- All SOC processes and procedures must be documented to ensure consistency, reliability, and continuous improvement. This includes, but is not limited to, alert handling, ticket creation, investigation steps, user and asset enumeration, escalation processes, and communication workflows.
- Documentation must include clear instructions, guidelines, and templates where appropriate, to ensure that any SOC analyst can follow the process effectively and consistently.
- Whenever a SOC analyst encounters a new process or investigative technique that is not documented, they must immediately raise it to SOC leadership for review and documentation.

#### 2. Documentation Backlog and Prioritization

- SOC leadership will maintain a running list (documentation backlog) of processes or procedures that need to be documented or updated.
- This backlog will be prioritized based on operational impact, with high-priority items (e.g., high-frequency processes or new investigative techniques) addressed first.
- SOC leadership will collaborate with the Documentation Team to ensure timely completion of documentation in alignment with the backlog priorities.

#### 3. Continuous Improvement and Feedback

- Documentation should evolve as new threats, tactics, and techniques emerge. SOC analysts are encouraged to provide feedback on existing documentation to ensure that it remains relevant, clear, and effective.
- If any member of the SOC identifies incomplete, vague, or outdated documentation, it should be raised for further discussion and revision.

#### 4. Transparency and Process Audits

- Documented processes must be made available to all SOC personnel and communicated transparently to ensure alignment across the team.
- SOC leadership will conduct regular audits of representative work outputs to evaluate adherence to documented processes. This ensures that any deviations from the documented procedures can be quickly identified and addressed.
- Audit results will be used to assess the effectiveness of documented processes and to identify opportunities for improvement.

#### 5. Documentation Lifecycle and Review

- Documentation will be reviewed and updated at least annually to ensure its relevance, accuracy, and completeness.
- Any new or changed documentation will be communicated to all SOC personnel through multiple channels (email, instant messages, shift handoffs).  Ref [[POL - Change Notifications]]
- SOC leadership is responsible for ensuring that all members of the SOC team are aware of updates to documentation, and training will be scheduled as needed to ensure understanding and compliance.

#### 2. Metrics and Reporting

- SOC leadership will track and report metrics on documentation creation, updates, and retirements on at least a monthly basis.
- These metrics will be used to assess the health of the documentation process and identify any bottlenecks or areas needing improvement.
- Regular reports will ensure that the SOC team is kept informed of progress on documentation and continuous improvement efforts.

## Enforcement and Compliance
By adhering to this policy, the SOC ensures that its processes are documented, reliable, and adaptable to the dynamic nature of the cybersecurity field. This documentation-driven approach will foster consistency, transparency, and trust within the SOC, while also supporting effective audit and quality control mechanisms that enhance the overall security posture. Failure to maintain proper documentation degrades the SOC performance and transparency. SOC leadership is responsible for ensuring compliance with this policy.

## Policy Review
This policy will be reviewed annually by all employees to ensure its continued relevance and effectiveness. Feedback and suggestions for improvement are welcome and should be directed to the SOC Leadership.
