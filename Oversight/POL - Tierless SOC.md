## Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to establish a tierless Security Operations Center (SOC) model that eliminates traditional tiered analyst structures. This approach enhances investigative ownership, promotes knowledge transfer, reduces operational risk, and fosters professional development. By ensuring that all analysts work across all levels of security incidents, the SOC will improve efficiency, reduce error rates associated with handoffs, and increase engagement and job satisfaction.
## Scope
This policy applies to all SOC personnel, including security analysts, incident responders, threat hunters, and SOC leadership. It governs all investigative and operational activities related to the detection, analysis, and response to security incidents.

| Incident Response (IR) Team | Assist with major security events and provide additional expertise while ensuring that primary ownership remains with the original investigating analyst.                                                         |

## Policy Statement
The SOC will operate under a tierless structure, requiring all analysts to engage in investigations at all levels of complexity. Handoff points between analysts will be minimized to reduce the risk of miscommunication and oversight. Instead, analysts will collaborate when required but retain responsibility for their investigations through closure. This model is designed to improve investigative quality, reduce burnout, and enhance engagement by providing all analysts with exposure to advanced investigations under the guidance of experienced personnel.
### Policy Elements

#### 1. **Full Lifecycle Ownership**####
Every analyst is responsible for the complete lifecycle of an investigation, from initial detection to final resolution, ensuring accountability and thoroughness.  Initial analyst assigned to the investigation is responsible for all documentation and notes for the investigation.

#### 2. **Collaborative Assistance**####
Analysts must engage senior or specialized colleagues for guidance when needed but remain the primary investigator throughout the process.

#### 3. **Elimination of Tiered Escalation**####
No rigid escalation process will be enforced; instead, cases will progress based on collaborative problem-solving and skill development.  In cases where senior assistance is required, junior analysts will call for assistance, but maintain ownership of investigations and adopt an assistive role in order to maintain continuity of knowledge and familiarity with all aspects of the investigation.

#### 4. **Risk Reduction**####
Reducing handoff points decreases the likelihood of miscommunication, data loss, and oversight in investigations.

#### 5. **Knowledge Transfer**####
Senior analysts will provide mentorship and direct collaboration rather than taking over investigations, ensuring continuous learning for all SOC personnel.

#### 6. **Burnout Prevention**####
By allowing all analysts to work on engaging and complex cases, the policy prevents stagnation and enhances job satisfaction.

#### 7. **Skill Development**####
All analysts are expected to develop expertise across the full spectrum of security operations, ensuring a resilient and adaptable SOC team.

## Enforcement and Compliance
Failure to adhere to the tierless SOC model may result in performance reviews and additional training requirements. SOC leadership will conduct regular assessments to ensure policy adherence and effectiveness. Analysts and leadership must provide feedback to refine the model continuously. Compliance will be measured through investigation quality metrics, incident resolution times, and analyst engagement surveys.

## Policy Review
This policy will be reviewed annually by all employees to ensure its continued relevance and effectiveness. Feedback and suggestions for improvement are welcome and should be directed to the SOC Leadership.
