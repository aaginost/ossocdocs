## Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to establish a structured approach for tracking, reporting, and reviewing Security Operations Center (SOC) performance and impact metrics. By collecting and analyzing key metrics, the SOC can measure effectiveness, support operational improvements, and provide meaningful insights to leadership. Metrics will be used to demonstrate SOC value without incentivizing rushed investigations, ensuring a continued focus on quality and thoroughness.
## Scope
This policy applies to all SOC personnel, including SOC Analysts, Shift Leads, SOC Leadership, and the SOC Director. It governs the collection, reporting, and utilization of SOC metrics at weekly, monthly, and quarterly intervals.

#### 2. Ensuring Metrics Support Quality Work

- SOC metrics should be structured to reflect thoroughness and effectiveness, not speed.
- Analysts must be encouraged to focus on the quality of investigations rather than prioritizing rapid closures.
- Quality assurance reviews must be integrated into the weekly reports to provide oversight and ensure accurate reporting.

#### 3. Continuous Improvement Through Metrics

- SOC Leadership must use collected metrics to assess operational gaps and propose improvements.
    - Each month, the SOC Manager should analyze the metrics and propose enhancement and improvement strategies to strengthen the security posture.
    - Proposals should include metrics of success to measure posture improvement.
    - Proposals will be reviewed and approved by the SOC Director.
    - SOC Director is responsible for ensuring implementation and project success for improvements.
- Metrics should inform decisions on tool investments, staffing, and training needs.
- Runbook and process documentation updates must be tracked to ensure continuous refinement of SOC operations.

## Enforcement and Compliance
This policy ensures that SOC operations are measurable, transparent, and continually improving while maintaining a focus on high-quality investigations and operational excellence. Non-compliance hampers the companyâ€™s ability to demonstrate value from investment in SOC and could result in risk to current funding and investment.

## Policy Review
This policy will be reviewed annually by all employees to ensure its continued relevance and effectiveness. Feedback and suggestions for improvement are welcome and should be directed to the SOC Leadership.
