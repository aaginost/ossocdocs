## Purpose
Detection Engineering (DE), also known as Content Development, is a critical function within a mature cybersecurity defense team. Security Operations Centers (SOCs) rely on tools such as Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) and Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) to continuously monitor the environment and respond to potential threats. While these tools typically come equipped with out-of-the-box detection rules, these default configurations are often generic and may not fully align with an organization’s unique risk profile, operational landscape, or evolving threat landscape.

To enhance the effectiveness of security monitoring, detection rules must be continuously tuned and optimized to reflect an organization’s specific environment. Additionally, as new vulnerabilities emerge and attacker techniques evolve, security teams must develop and deploy custom detection content to ensure comprehensive threat coverage. Maintaining the relevance and efficacy of SIEM and EDR tools requires an ongoing lifecycle of detection development, refinement, and adaptation to stay ahead of emerging threats.

## Scope
This process applies to detection engineering done by SOC engineers with the support of other internal and external teams.  This process is intended to be applied to security monitoring and response tools managed and maintained by the SOC
